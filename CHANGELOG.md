# Changelog

All notable changes to sluice are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

This section captures the work that has accumulated since the
initial design pass and not yet been cut into a tagged release. The
entries are grouped by capability rather than chronologically;
`git log` is the source of truth for commit-level history.

### Added — orchestration

- **Simple-mode `Migrator`**: one-shot schema-and-data migration
  with three-phase apply (tables-without-constraints → bulk row
  copy → identity-sequence sync → indexes → foreign keys). Wired
  into the kong `migrate` subcommand. CLI signals (Ctrl-C) cancel
  cleanly via context.
- **Continuous-sync `Streamer`**: long-running snapshot+CDC
  orchestrator. Cold start captures a consistent snapshot, runs
  the bulk-copy phase, then tails CDC events through to a target
  `ChangeApplier`. Warm resume reads the persisted position from
  the target's control table and skips the snapshot phase
  entirely. Wired into the `sluice sync start` subcommand.
- **Translation layer (`internal/translate`)**: per-column
  type-override layer that consumes the `mappings:` block from
  `sluice.yaml` and rewrites column types in the IR before the
  schema-write phase sees them. Strict on missing tables/columns
  (typos surface as startup errors). Initial alias set covers
  `text`, `text_array`, `jsonb`, `json`, `bytea`, `varchar`
  (with optional `length` option), and the eight `postgis_*`
  geometry shapes (with optional `srid`).

### Added — engines

- **MySQL engine** (vanilla, `mysql:` driver): SchemaReader,
  SchemaWriter, RowReader, RowWriter (LOAD DATA INFILE),
  CDCReader (row-based binlog via go-mysql), ChangeApplier,
  SnapshotStream (REPEATABLE READ + WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT
  pinned to the binlog position).
- **PlanetScale MySQL flavor** (`planetscale:` driver): same code
  paths as vanilla, with a capability declaration that disables
  `LOAD DATA INFILE` (uses BatchedInsert), turns off
  user-defined partitioning, and selects the VStream gRPC
  protocol for CDC.
- **Postgres engine** (`postgres:` driver): SchemaReader,
  SchemaWriter (with three-phase apply, identity-sequence sync,
  PostGIS-aware geometry emission, MySQL SET → TEXT[] with a
  CHECK constraint), RowReader, RowWriter (COPY FROM STDIN),
  CDCReader (pgoutput logical replication via pglogrepl),
  ChangeApplier, SnapshotStream (CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT +
  EXPORT_SNAPSHOT + SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT for atomic
  snapshot-to-CDC handoff).

### Added — managed-service support

- **PlanetScale Postgres** (PS-PG): the vanilla `postgres` engine
  works against PS-PG without code changes. All six verification
  phases pass against a real PS-PG account: connectivity, schema
  reader, simple-mode migration, CDC reader, snapshot+CDC
  streamer, and cross-engine PS-MySQL → PS-PG. See
  [docs/managed-services.md](docs/managed-services.md).
- **PlanetScale MySQL via VStream**: Vitess's gRPC streaming
  protocol is now sluice's CDC path for the PlanetScale flavor.
  Capability declaration declares `CDCVStream` so the streamer
  accepts the flavor. Position encoding is JSON `[]shardGtid`
  matching Debezium's persistence shape, future-proofing for
  multi-keyspace migrations.
- **Vanilla Vitess deployments**: the same `planetscale` flavor
  covers self-hosted Vitess, with DSN flags to opt out of
  PlanetScale-specific defaults: `vstream_transport=plaintext`,
  `vstream_auth=none`, `vstream_shards=<custom>`,
  `vstream_endpoint=<host:port>`. Verified against
  `vitess/vttestserver` via testcontainers.

### Added — types and translation policies

- **MySQL SET → PostgreSQL TEXT[]** (default policy): SET columns
  emerge on the target as `TEXT[]` with a table-level
  `CONSTRAINT <table>_<column>_set CHECK (... <@ ARRAY[...])`
  enforcing membership. Comma-separated MySQL DEFAULTs translate
  to PG array literals so the source default survives the
  rewrite.
- **PostGIS-aware GEOMETRY emission**: PG engine detects PostGIS
  at writer-open time. With the extension installed, ir.Geometry
  columns emit as `geometry(<subtype>, <srid>)`; without it the
  existing loud rejection persists (sluice doesn't auto-install
  extensions). MySQL SRID-prefixed WKB → PostGIS EWKB framing
  via `wkbToEWKB`. Per-column SRID flows through the translate
  layer's `postgis_*` aliases.
- **TRUNCATE detection in CDC** for both binlog and VStream
  paths. The narrow `parseTruncateTable` parser recognises
  `TRUNCATE [TABLE] [<schema>.]<table>` shapes and emits
  `ir.Truncate`; out-of-shape statements fall through to the
  cache-invalidation path.
- **MySQL TINYINT(1) → PG BOOLEAN** through both the snapshot
  bulk-copy path and the CDC stream, validated by the
  cross-engine integration test.
- **MySQL UNSIGNED BIGINT → PG NUMERIC(20,0)**, with auto-
  increment widening to BIGINT IDENTITY when applicable.
- **MySQL ENUM → PG enum type** with per-column generated type
  names, default-value casting handled inline.
- **MySQL JSON → PG JSONB** by default (canonical fast path);
  override to `json` (text) via mappings if needed.

### Added — testing

- **Integration suite** (`integration` build tag): testcontainers
  pairs cover MySQL→MySQL, PG→PG, MySQL→PG, PG→MySQL one-shot
  migrations, plus PG→PG and MySQL→PG continuous-sync streaming
  with restart-resume. The cross-engine seed exercises every
  type-translation policy in one fixture.
- **PostGIS suite** (`integration && postgis` build tag): boots
  `postgis/postgis:16-3.4`, exercises end-to-end MySQL → PG
  geometry round-trip with `ST_AsText` verification.
- **PlanetScale verification suite** (`psverify` build tag):
  exercises sluice's PG and MySQL paths against a real
  PlanetScale account using credentials from
  `PLANETSCALE_CREDENTIALS.env` or env vars. Includes
  connectivity probe (logs version, wal_level, REPLICATION
  attribute, PostGIS state), schema reader round-trip, simple-
  mode migration, CDC reader, continuous-sync streamer, and
  cross-engine verification. CI workflow at
  `.github/workflows/psverify.yml` (manual-trigger only).
- **VStream suite** (`integration && vstream` build tag):
  testcontainers-based against `vitess/vttestserver:mysql80`,
  exercises the FlavorPlanetScale CDC path against vanilla
  Vitess (plaintext + no-auth) including INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
  and TRUNCATE.

### Added — CI

- Four-job CI workflow: cross-platform unit Test (Linux, macOS,
  Windows), Integration on Linux, Lint, and cross-platform
  Build smoke-test. Required for branch protection on main.
- Manual-trigger PlanetScale verification workflow with
  per-environment secrets for the four PS DSNs.

### Architecture and process

- 10 ADRs in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) capture the load-bearing
  design decisions: IR-first translation, sealed interfaces,
  kong+koanf, three-phase schema apply, MySQL flavors, pgoutput
  over wal2json, position persistence on the target, go-mysql
  for binlog parsing, Streamer as separate orchestrator, and
  idempotent applier semantics.
- Documentation under [docs/](docs/): architecture overview,
  type-mapping policies, runtime value contract, testing guide,
  managed-services compatibility matrix, and a sakila-based
  end-to-end walkthrough.

### Removed

- The pre-translate placeholder mappings handling in `Migrator`
  and `Streamer`. Replaced by `translate.ApplyMappings` between
  schema-read and schema-write.

### Known limitations

- **Sharded Vitess keyspaces** are out of scope for v1. The
  VStream reader subscribes to a fixed shard layout supplied via
  the `vstream_shards` DSN parameter; reshard auto-discovery and
  multi-shard COPY handoff are planned follow-ups.
- **VStream snapshot+CDC handoff** for PlanetScale MySQL: phase B
  ships the streaming spine, but `OpenSnapshotStream` for the
  PlanetScale flavor still uses the binlog-based path that
  PlanetScale doesn't expose. The `Streamer` therefore can't
  coldStart against PlanetScale today; CDC-only consumers and
  out-of-band snapshots both work. Wiring VStream's built-in
  COPY mode into `OpenSnapshotStream` is a planned chunk.
- **PostGIS schema-reader subtype/SRID introspection**: the
  schema reader currently surfaces all geometry columns as
  `ir.Geometry{Subtype: GeometryUnspecified, SRID: 0}`; the
  precise subtype + SRID live in PG's `geometry_columns` view
  but aren't yet reconstructed during schema read. v1 callers
  that care about subtype precision pass it explicitly via
  `mappings`.
